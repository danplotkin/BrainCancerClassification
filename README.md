# Brain Cancer Classification


### About 

This repository contains code for classifying the brain cancer tumors into the following classes:

1. **Gliomas:** These are tumors that develop from glial cells, which are cells that support the neurons in the brain. Gliomas are the most common type of brain tumor.
2. **Meningiomas:** These are tumors that develop from the meninges, which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. 
3. **Pituitary adenomas:** These are tumors that develop in the pituitary gland, which is a small gland at the base of the brain that controls hormone production.
4. **No tumor**

We will be using the VGG11_bn convolutional neural network to fine-tuning the pre-trained weights on the dataset of interest. The code is implemented in PyTorch.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) used in this project contains brain MRI scans of patients with different types of tumors, including glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. This project will demonstrate how Deep Learning and Computer Vision is used in cancer research.

### Results

Our final model had a 96.26% accuracy to unseen data.
